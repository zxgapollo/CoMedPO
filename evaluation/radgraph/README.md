##  F1-RadGraph score
Usage:
```python
from radgraph import F1RadGraph
refs = ["no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality",
        "endotracheal tube is present and bibasilar opacities likely represent mild atelectasis",
]

hyps = ["no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality",
        "et tube terminates 2 cm above the carina and bibasilar opacities"
]
f1radgraph = F1RadGraph(reward_level="all", model_type="radgraph-xl")
mean_reward, reward_list, hypothesis_annotation_lists, reference_annotation_lists = f1radgraph(hyps=hyps, refs=refs)

rg_e, rg_er, rg_bar_er = mean_reward

print(mean_reward)
```
Output:
```
(np.float64(0.75), np.float64(0.6666666666666666), np.float64(0.6538461538461539))
```
Over the years, RG_ER has been reported widely in RRG papers.

##  Processed Annotations
```python
import json
from radgraph import get_radgraph_processed_annotations, RadGraph

report = """
Mild pulmonary edema with probable small bilateral pleural effusions.  
More focal opacities at lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded.
"""
model_type = "modern-radgraph-xl"
radgraph = RadGraph(model_type=model_type)
annotations = radgraph(
    [report]
    )

processed_annotations = get_radgraph_processed_annotations(annotations)
for annotation in processed_annotations["processed_annotations"]:
    located_at = f" [Location: {', '.join(annotation['located_at'])}]" if annotation["located_at"] else ""
    suggestive_of = f" [Suggestive of: {', '.join(annotation['suggestive_of'])}]" if annotation["suggestive_of"] else ""
    tag = f" [Tag: {annotation['tags'][0]}]"
    print(f"Observation: {annotation['observation']}{located_at}{suggestive_of}{tag}")
```
Output:

```
Observation: mild edema [Location: pulmonary] [Tag: definitely present]
Observation: small effusions [Location: bilateral pleural] [Tag: uncertain]
Observation: focal opacities [Location: lung bases] [Suggestive of: opacities suggestive of atelectasis, opacities suggestive of infection] [Tag: definitely present]
Observation: atelectasis [Tag: uncertain]
Observation: infection [Tag: uncertain]
